## Tasks - Real-Time Sync Fixed

### What Was Done
- Added real-time Firestore sync to Tasks/Kanban board
- Replaced polling with `subscribeToTasks()` using `onSnapshot`
- Tasks now update instantly when changed

- Fixed by removing token from memory files

- `src/utils/firebase.js` - Added `subscribeToTasks()` function
- `MEMORY.md` - Cleaned up stale references
